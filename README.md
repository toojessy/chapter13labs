# **Why can’t you instantiate the Enemy class?**
# **What would happen if a subclass did not implement update() or attack()?**
# **How does using Enemy[] demonstrate polymorphism?**
# **Why is it helpful for Enemy to have a concrete method like takeDamage()?**
# **Could this design be implemented using interfaces alone? Why or why not?**
